# SCME interface to ASE
In here, an interface was written to do the transformation between the output of SCME code and  ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)
This code also can do the numerical force calculation based on the values of energies.
Moreover, it is capable to do numerical force calculationis in parallel with MPI
